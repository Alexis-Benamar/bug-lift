> _look at him go!_

A silly little [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) project based on this silly little guy with an incredible neck. Now interactive!

## How to run locally

First, clone the project on your pc.

You will need `node` & `browser-sync` installed globally in order to run the project as a web server (otherwise, images won't be loaded in the browser)
```
npm i -g browser-sync
```

Then, go inside the project's folder & run it with the following command:
```
browser-sync start --server -f -w --no-open
```
